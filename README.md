# ibz_bldc_project
A group project I participated in during my time in the IBZ side school. The task was any electronic project, so three other fellow students and I decided to build a BLDC driver.
I took care of the schematic, components and layout, another one handled assembly & basic testing, one did the programming / controlling and the last documented the whole project.
This project is not maintained but more a rough reference if anyone else wants to build something similar.
It uses the L6234 as BLDC driver and offers either HALL-Sensor Input or Back-EMF (selectable via jumpers) as well as enough test points to probe on. It was laid out to be a rather flexible but basic platform to explore BLDC Motor driving a bit more.
